## [From Zero to Fully Operational Developer Platform in 5 Steps!](/internal-developer-platforms/from-zero-to-fully-operational-developer-platform-in-5-steps)

Internal Developer Platforms or IDPs are **not hard to create**. Anyone can do it, as long as that someone knows **everything about everything**.

Today I'll show you **everything** you should know **about developer platforms**. We'll go through all the principles behind them, through all the components they should have, and I'll even show you how to build one. This will be a tutorial on how to build a platform in **4 mandatory and 1 optional step**.

At the end of today's journey, we'll have a **fully operational IDP** with everything you might need. Most likely...

## [Why I Changed My Mind About Backstage? A Brutally Honest Opinion](/internal-developer-platforms/why-i-changed-my-mind-about-backstage-a-brutally-honest-opinion)

I was **very negative towards Backstage**. Some of the architectural choices are, in my opinion, bad. The way to install plugins is just silly. The quality of most of the plugins is very low. The need to rebuild container image every time we make a change is something I thought we will never see again. And so on and so forth.

Now, however, my impressions about Backstage changed. Actually, that's not true. I still stand behind everything I said about it. What changed is the additional impression. Now **I think I get it.** Now I think I understand why Backstage makes sense, why it is one of the most contributed project and why it might make sense to adopt it even though it's bad.

## [From UX to API: Mastering Platform Validations with Kubernetes Validating Admission Policies](/internal-developer-platforms/from-ux-to-api-mastering-platform-validations-with-kubernetes-validating-admission-policies)

**Validations** are extremely important when building Internal Developer Platforms, or any platforms for that matter. They serve two primary purposes. They help us ensure that user's requests are valid before they are processed by the platform and they make user experience better. The problem, however, is that people mix those two all the time. One is ensuring that something is **valid** and the other is improving **user experience** without guaranteering validity of the requests. The first group are "real" policies while the other is just UX.

## [Full Application Setup in Internal Developer Platform (IDP) with Crossplane](/internal-developer-platforms/full-application-setup-in-internal-developer-platform-idp-with-crossplane)

What if I tell you that fifty of so lines of YAML will get you everything you might need to work on an application. What if everything includes **Git repo**, **branches**, **pull requests**, **CI workflows**, **scripts** needed both for local development and CI, **Dockerfile**, a bunch of **Kubernetes resources** and quite a few other things you might need. What if everything is really everything and, at the same time, tailor-made for **your specific needs**?

## [How to Create Custom CLIs That Make Your DevOps Life Easier - Nushell](/terminal/how-to-create-custom-clis-that-make-your-devops-life-easier---nushell)

When building user interfaces for developer platforms or, frankly, for anything else, we tend to **focus mostly on Web UIs**. That's why there is a surge in popularity of portals like Backstage, Port, and many others. Still, user interfaces can have many other forms and, more often than not, a single one is not enough. The truth is that some forms are more appropriate for some tasks while others for other tasks.

## [Top 10 DevOps Tools You MUST Use in 2025!](/misc/top-10-devops-tools-you-must-use-in-2025)

Today is the day I announce which tools I recommend using in 2025.

This is the list of the best of the best.

Creme de la creme.

I'm lying. This is not the list of the best tools but, rather, the list of the tools that made impact in 2024, the tools that matured enough that I recommend as permanent tools in your toolbelt. It's the list of tools that proved their worth and should be adopted in 2025. Some of them are the best in their respective category, while others made a significant shift in the way we work that I believe deserve to be in the spotlight. Some are small, while others are massive. Some are widely known while others are obscure.

## [Is This the End of Crossplane? Compose Kubernetes Resources with kro](/internal-developer-platforms/is-this-the-end-of-crossplane-compose-kubernetes-resources-with-kro)

Whomever is building developer platforms is bound to come to the conclusion that there is **a need to compose resources and expose those compositions through APIs**. If a developer needs a database, they should be able to specify what that database should be without having to deal with subnets, VPCs, internet gateways, and other lower-level components that are required, but are not important for the vast majority of people who just want a database. We are likely to come to a similar conclusion if, for example, a developer wants to run an application. That developer might want to specify a container image, a port, and a host without having to worry about Kubernetes Deployments, Services, Ingresses, Scalers, VirtualServices, and other lower-level Kubernetes types of objects.
