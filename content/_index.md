## [From Boring to Productive: Customize Your Shell Prompt with Starship](/terminal/from-boring-to-productive-customize-your-shell-prompt-with-starship)

What I'm about to say might sound silly, but I'm going to say it anyway.

One of the easiest ways to improve productivity is by having a **good Shell prompt**.

I, for example, tend to have a minimal prompt that shows only the pending actions I need to perform.

> Do NOT try to execute the commands in this section. We'll go through the setup and details in the next sections. This is only the preview of what's comming.

```
dotfiles-demo 
âžœ 
```

That means that, most of the time, the only information shown in my prompt is the current directory which, in this case, is `dotfiles-demo`. It is a boring prompt, by design.

However, let's see what happens if...

## [GitOps Broke CI/CD! Here is How to Fix It With Argo Events](/ci-cd/gitops-broke-ci-cd-here-is-how-to-fix-it-with-argo-events)

**GitOps is amazing**, especially for those using Kubernetes. Yet, GitOps poses significant problems when it comes to execution of tasks that should be performed after deployments. For example, we cannot run functional tests through workflows or pipelines like GitHub Actions or Jenkins. **GitOps broke CI/CD processes**, and we need to fix that.

Let me explain.

## [Scaling Explained Through Kubernetes HPA, VPA, KEDA & Cluster Autoscaler](/kubernetes/scaling-explained-through-kubernetes-hpa-vpa-keda--cluster-autoscaler)

Scaling is probably one of the most important aspects of computing, and a common cause of bankrupcy.

If our processes use more memory and CPU than what they need, they are wasting money or "stealing" those resources from others thus making them less efficient. On the other hand,if we give processes less memory and CPU than what they need, their performance will be affected negatively making user experience suck. And that's the good outcome. Much worse situation is that underpowered processes might crash with "out of memory" and other similar exceptions.

Hence, the goal is to assign just the right amount of resources to processes. Not too much, not to few, but just right. We do that through scaling, and we need to answer three questions.

* **What do we scale?**
* **Where do we scale?**
* **Who scales?**

## [Mastering Developer Portals: Discover & Integrate API Schemas with Port](/internal-developer-platforms/mastering-developer-portals-discover--integrate-api-schemas-with-port)

I am so **dissaspointed with developer portal consoles** for ignoring the fact that almost **everything is discoverable through APIs**. Why should I design forms and fields in Backstage if Backstage should be able to ask an API for a schema? Even if that schema is not exactly what I need and I might have to remove parts of it, that's still easier and better than starting from scratch. It's a waste of time to do the same thing over and over again. We should define what we have, expose that through an API, and all other tools should just "discover" it. Just as that's true for, let's say, `kubectl`, it should be true for graphical user interfaces.

Hence, I spent months complaining about it and... I got it.

Well... Wait until you see what I can query from such a database.
