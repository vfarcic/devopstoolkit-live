## [How to Create Custom CLIs That Make Your DevOps Life Easier - Nushell](/terminal/how-to-create-custom-clis-that-make-your-devops-life-easier---nushell)

When building user interfaces for developer platforms or, frankly, for anything else, we tend to **focus mostly on Web UIs**. That's why there is a surge in popularity of portals like Backstage, Port, and many others. Still, user interfaces can have many other forms and, more often than not, a single one is not enough. The truth is that some forms are more appropriate for some tasks while others for other tasks.

## [Top 10 DevOps Tools You MUST Use in 2025!](/misc/top-10-devops-tools-you-must-use-in-2025)

Today is the day I announce which tools I recommend using in 2025.

This is the list of the best of the best.

Creme de la creme.

I'm lying. This is not the list of the best tools but, rather, the list of the tools that made impact in 2024, the tools that matured enough that I recommend as permanent tools in your toolbelt. It's the list of tools that proved their worth and should be adopted in 2025. Some of them are the best in their respective category, while others made a significant shift in the way we work that I believe deserve to be in the spotlight. Some are small, while others are massive. Some are widely known while others are obscure.

## [Is This the End of Crossplane? Compose Kubernetes Resources with kro](/internal-developer-platforms/is-this-the-end-of-crossplane-compose-kubernetes-resources-with-kro)

Whomever is building developer platforms is bound to come to the conclusion that there is **a need to compose resources and expose those compositions through APIs**. If a developer needs a database, they should be able to specify what that database should be without having to deal with subnets, VPCs, internet gateways, and other lower-level components that are required, but are not important for the vast majority of people who just want a database. We are likely to come to a similar conclusion if, for example, a developer wants to run an application. That developer might want to specify a container image, a port, and a host without having to worry about Kubernetes Deployments, Services, Ingresses, Scalers, VirtualServices, and other lower-level Kubernetes types of objects.

## [Mastering Kubernetes: Volumes (emptyDir, CSI Drivers, Storage Classes, Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims, ConfigMaps, and Secrets)](/kubernetes/mastering-kubernetes-volumes-emptydir-csi-drivers-storage-classes-persistent-volumes-and-persistent-volume-claims-configmaps-and-secrets)

Today we'll go through Kubernetes volumes. We'll explore local volumes like emptyDir, CSI Drivers, Storage Classes, Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. It does not matter what you do in Kubernetes, **volumes are unavoidable**. You will use them, so you need to understand what they're used for, when to use them, and how to use them.

## [Your Cluster Is Not Safe: The Dark Side of Backups](/kubernetes/your-cluster-isnt-safe-the-dark-side-of-backups)

We all want to feel safe. That's why we create backups. We want to know that our systems will survive no mather what happens.

The feeling of safety is very very important, and I need to appologise in advance for what I'm about to say.

You are **NOT safe**. If the disaster happens, you might not be able to survive it.

Here's why.

**Backups alone are not enough!**; especially if its only one type of a backup.

When the day of reckoning comes, **you will NOT be saved!**

Let me prove that to you.

## [Master Kubernetes Backups with Velero: Step-by-Step Guide](/kubernetes/master-kubernetes-backups-with-velero-step-by-step-guide)

Do you think your Kubernetes clusters are safe and able to withstand anything and everything?

Truth be told, Kuberentes is **very resilient**. It was designed to be highly available and fault tollerant. You hopefully know all that and, if you do, you probably also know that nothing is 100% resilient. Bad things happen. Unexpected things happen, and we should be **prepared for anything and everything**. Backups are a part of that preparation. We are or, at least, we should be creating them regularly in hope that we'll never have to restore any of them. Yet, we might be in a situation when restoring a backup is our last option, especially in cases when a cluster is completely gone and the only option left is to create a new one and restore a backup which, hopefully, should result in the new cluster running the same resources, having the same data, showing the same logs, and everything else that we had in the old cluster that is now dead.
