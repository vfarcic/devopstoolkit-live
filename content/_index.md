## [Terraform vs. Crossplane vs. Ansible - Rivals or Allies?](/wasm/unleashing-webassembly-in-kubernetes-with-kwasm)

I am often asked to compare Crossplane with Terraform, or Pulumi, or Ansible, or any other tool that primarily manages resources, be it those in hyperscalers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, or in Kubernetes, or anywhere else. Well... Today I'm here to tell you that none of those tools are going away any time soon. We need all of those. We need configuration management tools like Ansible, we need Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Pulumi, and we need control planes, be it opinionated ones like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, or those that allow us to build our own control planes like Crossplane.

## [From Makefile to Justfile (or Taskfile): Recipe Runner Replacement](/ci-cd/from-makefile-to-justfile-or-taskfile-recipe-runner-replacement)

When I work locally, if I need to create a cluster I just execute `cluster-create`, wait for a few moments, and a local cluster with everything I need is running.

## [Mastering Kubernetes Debugging: Leveraging eBPF with Inspektor Gadget](/observability/inspektor-gadget-kubernetes-debugging-ebpf)

Kubernetes ecosystem is one of the most, if not the most extensive we've ever seen. There are tools for everything, including observability. We can collect metrics, logs, and traces for almost anything, we can query them, and we can see them in dashboards. There are hundreds of solutions for that alone, yet, sometimes, I miss simplicity of tools I would normally use in Linux. Sometimes, I crave for **simple commands** similar to those I would use when trying to figure out what's going on in a single server.

## [Mastering Kubernetes: Dive into Service and Network APIs](/kubernetes/services-ingress-cluster-api)

In the [Mastering Kubernetes: Dive into Workloads APIs](https://youtu.be/U6weXlzQxoY) video we explored Kubernetes **Workload APIs**. We saw the differences between **Pods**, **ReplicaSets**, **Jobs**, **Deployments**, **StatefulSets**, **DaemonSets**, and **CronJobs**.

When I asked whether it would be interesting to explore another set of Kubernetes APIs, you overwhelmed me with responses that all say "**Yes. Do more!**" So, today we will continue where we left.

## [Single Pane of Glass for Kubernetes Clusters with Clusterpedia](/kubernetes/clusterpedia)

For a while now, we have tools that promise that we can manage a **fleet of Kubernetes clusters** as one, yet they all failed to do just that. They all failed to provide a single pane of glass for all the clusters in a fleet. All the tools I know eventually show us what is happening in a single cluster and, honestly, I don't need tools for that. I can easily see what's going on in a cluster with kubectl or any, literally any, Kubernetes dashboard. What I'm missing, and what all the tools I tried so far fail to deliver, is a **single pane of glass** for all my Kubernetes clusters.

## [How Platform Engineering Compares to Running a Restaurant](/internal-developer-platforms/platform-engineering-menu)

Platform engineering should follow similar patterns as restaurants, yet we often confuse it with a kitchen or a supermarket.
