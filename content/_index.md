## [Mastering Developer Portals: Discover & Integrate API Schemas with Port](/internal-developer-platforms/mastering-developer-portals-discover--integrate-api-schemas-with-port)

I am so **dissaspointed with developer portal consoles** for ignoring the fact that almost **everything is discoverable through APIs**. Why should I design forms and fields in Backstage if Backstage should be able to ask an API for a schema? Even if that schema is not exactly what I need and I might have to remove parts of it, that's still easier and better than starting from scratch. It's a waste of time to do the same thing over and over again. We should define what we have, expose that through an API, and all other tools should just "discover" it. Just as that's true for, let's say, `kubectl`, it should be true for graphical user interfaces.

Hence, I spent months complaining about it and... I got it.

## [Single Pane of Glass for Everything (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, ...) with Steampipe](/cloud/single-pane-of-glass-for-everything-aws-azure-gcp-kubernetes-with-steampipe)

Right now, I am connected to a PostgreSQL database and you are thinking that is boring. Who wants to see me querying a database?

Well... Wait until you see what I can query from such a database.

## [Unleashing WebAssembly in Kubernetes with Kwasm](/wasm/unleashing-webassembly-in-kubernetes-with-kwasm)

I am going to show you something you've seen many times before. Yet, looks can be deceiving. You will likely come to a wrong conclusion. What I will show is not what it might look like.

## [From Makefile to Justfile (or Taskfile): Recipe Runner Replacement](/ci-cd/from-makefile-to-justfile-or-taskfile-recipe-runner-replacement)

When I work locally, if I need to create a cluster I just execute `cluster-create`, wait for a few moments, and a local cluster with everything I need is running.

## [Terraform vs. Crossplane vs. Ansible - Rivals or Allies?](/infrastructure-as-code/ansible-vs-terraform-vs-crossplane)

I am often asked to compare Crossplane with Terraform, or Pulumi, or Ansible, or any other tool that primarily manages resources, be it those in hyperscalers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, or in Kubernetes, or anywhere else. Well... Today I'm here to tell you that none of those tools are going away any time soon. We need all of those. We need configuration management tools like Ansible, we need Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Pulumi, and we need control planes, be it opinionated ones like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, or those that allow us to build our own control planes like Crossplane.

## [Mastering Kubernetes Debugging: Leveraging eBPF with Inspektor Gadget](/observability/inspektor-gadget-kubernetes-debugging-ebpf)

Kubernetes ecosystem is one of the most, if not the most extensive we've ever seen. There are tools for everything, including observability. We can collect metrics, logs, and traces for almost anything, we can query them, and we can see them in dashboards. There are hundreds of solutions for that alone, yet, sometimes, I miss simplicity of tools I would normally use in Linux. Sometimes, I crave for **simple commands** similar to those I would use when trying to figure out what's going on in a single server.

## [Mastering Kubernetes: Dive into Service and Network APIs](/kubernetes/services-ingress-cluster-api)

In the [Mastering Kubernetes: Dive into Workloads APIs](https://youtu.be/U6weXlzQxoY) video we explored Kubernetes **Workload APIs**. We saw the differences between **Pods**, **ReplicaSets**, **Jobs**, **Deployments**, **StatefulSets**, **DaemonSets**, and **CronJobs**.

When I asked whether it would be interesting to explore another set of Kubernetes APIs, you overwhelmed me with responses that all say "**Yes. Do more!**" So, today we will continue where we left.
