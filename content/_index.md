## [Surviving Backstage with Roadie: A Developer's Nightmare or Dream?](/internal-developer-platforms/surviving-backstage-with-roadie-a-developers-nightmare-or-dream)

Today I want to talk about **potentially the most important tool in your toolbox**. I want to talk about a tool that might **enable everyone** in your organization **to be more productive and self-sufficient**. Yet, the tool I want to talk about might win an award for the **least user-friendly**, **hardest to maintain**, and, generally speaking, a tool that might cause you to have **nightmares** and spend a small fortune on a psychologist.

It's a tool that I recognize as being **one of the most impactful tools** which, honestly, I do not like at all, yet most of those who use it swear by it.

Did you guess what that tool is?

## [Master Terminal Multiplexing with Zellij in Minutes!](/terminal/master-terminal-multiplexing-with-zellij-in-minutes)

Let me show you something exciting, something that makes me much more productive.

I am going to execute command `zellij`, specify a name of the session (`crossplane-kubernetes`), and a layout (`test-layout.kdl`), and...

```sh
zellij --session crossplane-kubernetes --layout test-layout.kdl
```

BOOM!

There's everything I need, nicely split into tabs and panes.

## [Automate Everything: How One Manifest Powers Your Entire DevOps Pipeline](/internal-developer-platforms/automate-everything-how-one-manifest-powers-your-entire-devops-pipeline)

Today I want to get back to the first steps when developer platforms are concerned. I want to enable developers to start a new project.

## [The Dark Side of Open Source: Are We All Just Selfish?](/misc/the-dark-side-of-open-source-are-we-all-just-selfish)

There's a lot of talk about open source and about some companies, big and small, taking advantage of it, and about some other companies changing licenses of their projects to be less permissive. Those conversations often end up with people yelling at each other. "**Damn MongoDB for changing their license!**" "**AWS is evil for taking advantage of Elastic!**" "**Env0 is taking advantage of HashiCorp!**" "**F\*\*K HashiCorp!**" "**Long live Elastic!**"

## [Master Your New Laptop Setup: Tools, Configs, and Secrets!](/terminal/master-your-new-laptop-setup-tools-configs-and-secrets)

This is a new machine. I just got it. It has nothing on it beyond what's available out-of-the box.

Actually, that's not true. The only thing I did was to clone a Git repo. That's it. That's all I have on this machine, for now.

## [10 CLIs I Can Not Live Without!](/terminal/why-i-can-not-live-without-these-10-clis)

Today we'll explore **ten CLI tools** without which my life would be meaningless. Well... Maybe not meaningless, but certainly much less productive and harder.

So, without further ado, those are tend CLIs I use on a daily basis, and you should use them as well.

## [Transform Your Terminal: 3 Must-Have Zsh Plugins!](/terminal/transform-your-terminal-3-must-have-zsh-plugins)

I use Zsh as my shell. It is the default shell in macOS and available in any other operating system. There's **no way I'll ever go back to Bash** and the only other Shell comparable to Zsh is Fish.

Fish is great, maybe even better than Zsh, but it's **not POSIX compliant** meaning that some of the commands I would use in Fish might not work elsewhere. Zsh, on the other hand, is POSIX compliant meaning that whatever I do in it would work in any other Shell, except Fish. Compatibility wins.

All in all, Zsh is great and I love it. However, Zsh alone is... well, it's **just a shell**. We need to extend it to make it truly great.

Specifically, there are **three must-have plugins**. With those we'll explore today, Zsh gets transformed from "yet another shell" to "I can't live without it".

Here it goes. Here are the three must-have Zsh plugins that will transform the way you work.
