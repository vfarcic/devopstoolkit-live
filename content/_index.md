## [Single Pane of Glass for Kubernetes Clusters with Clusterpedia](/kubernetes/clusterpedia)

For a while now, we have tools that promise that we can manage a **fleet of Kubernetes clusters** as one, yet they all failed to do just that. They all failed to provide a single pane of glass for all the clusters in a fleet. All the tools I know eventually show us what is happening in a single cluster and, honestly, I don't need tools for that. I can easily see what's going on in a cluster with kubectl or any, literally any, Kubernetes dashboard. What I'm missing, and what all the tools I tried so far fail to deliver, is a **single pane of glass** for all my Kubernetes clusters.

## [Exploring KCL: Configuration and Data Structure Language; CUE and Pkl Replacement?](/app-management/kcl)

**I'm in pain**... and it's self-inflicted... and I like it.

I tend to go through an endless number of tools, services, and format in search for better ways to do my job. I'm never satisfied. I always think that there is something better out there. So I go through pain of learning a new tool or a language only to jump into a new one shortly afterwards. Spending endless hours going through new stuff does not make sense, but I can't help myself. Hopefully, I might save you from doing it yourself. That's my goal. Go through the pain of trying out everything so that you don't have to.
