## [Stop Blaming AI: Vector DBs + RAG = Game Changer](/ai/stop-blaming-ai-vector-dbs-rag-game-changer)

Let me guess. You tried AI, it hallucinated something completely wrong, and now you're back to doing everything manually while complaining that "AI doesn't work."

Maybe you're a developer who asked it about your codebase, and it confidently explained functions that don't exist. Or suggested using deprecated APIs your team abandoned two years ago. Perhaps it recommended architectural patterns that directly contradict your team's decisions.

Or you're in ops, and it gets even worse. You asked about your backup policies, and it invented procedures you've never implemented. You requested help with a Kubernetes deployment, and it suggested configurations that violate every security standard you have. You wanted it to troubleshoot a production issue, and it gave you generic advice that would take down your entire cluster.

## [Stop Wasting Time: Turn AI Prompts Into Production Code](/ai/stop-wasting-time-turn-ai-prompts-into-production-code)

I spent three hours writing the perfect prompt. Three. Damn. Hours. And you know what? The AI still screwed it up. Not because the AI was bad, but because I was doing it completely wrong. I was treating prompts like throwaway commands when I should have been treating them like **production code**.

Here's what nobody tells you about AI prompts: they're not just instructions. They're **your team's collective knowledge**, encoded in a way that AI can execute. And if you're not treating them as first-class citizens in your codebase, you're wasting everyone's time. Today, I'm going to show you how to turn your prompts into a shared asset that evolves with your team, deploys like any other code, and actually makes AI useful instead of frustrating.

We'll start by understanding why context is everything in AI, then I'll show you the evolution of a real prompt from 5 words to 500, and finally reveal how MCP changes the entire game for prompt distribution. Let's dive in.

## [AI Will Replace Coders - But Not the Way You Think](/ai/ai-will-replace-coders---but-not-the-way-you-think)

I've been in tech for over three decades, and **I've never seen developers this scared**. Not during the dot-com crash. Not during outsourcing waves. Not even during the layoffs. This time it's different because the threat isn't coming from other humans. It's coming from AI that can already write code faster than us. And here's what should really worry you: we're on a trajectory where soon it might write better code too.

But here's what pisses me off: **Everyone's panicking about the wrong thing**. They're worried AI will take their jobs because it can write code. That's like a chef worrying about losing their job because someone invented a better knife. You're missing the point entirely.

In this post, I'm going to tell you what your job actually is, why most developers have been doing it wrong for years, and how AI is about to expose that brutal reality. But I'll also show you exactly how to adapt, because those who get this right won't just survive. They'll thrive. And the questions I keep hearing prove that most people don't get it yet.

## [AI Meets Kubernetes: Simplifying Developer and Ops Collaboration](/app-management/ai-meets-kubernetes-simplifying-developer-and-ops-collaboration)

Platform engineers face a tough challenge: **developers know what they need**, but they don't understand complex infrastructure. Platform engineers understand infrastructure, but they struggle to anticipate every developer requirement. The result? **Internal Developer Platforms** that miss the mark and platforms that require endless iterations to make them useful.

But what if there was a **third collaborator** that could bridge this gap? AI has vast technical knowledge but doesn't know your company's specific rules and constraints. However, when you combine developer intent, platform engineering expertise, and AI's technical knowledge, something powerful emerges.

I'm about to show you a working system that demonstrates this three-way collaboration. We'll watch developers express their needs in natural language, see AI translate those into deployments using platform engineering building blocks, and then I'll reveal the architecture that makes this possible.

## [Can AI Replace Your Terraform Modules? Infrastructure's New Future](/ai/can-ai-replace-your-terraform-modules-infrastructures-new-future)

My AI agent just **failed** to create a database. It forgot the resource group, messed up the credentials, and made three attempts before getting it right.

But here's the plot twist: That's the **best** thing that could have happened.

Today, I'm going to show you why AI agents might make your carefully crafted golden paths **obsolete**. Why those Terraform modules or similar abstractions you spent months building might be holding AI back, and why letting AI fail and learn might be the future of infrastructure management.

## [The End of Infrastructure-as-Code: AI Changes Everything](/infrastructure-as-code/the-end-of-infrastructure-as-code-ai-changes-everything)

Here's something that might shock you: every Infrastructure-as-Code tool you're using today will be **dead** in upcoming years. Terraform, Pulumi; all of them. And the killer? AI agents that don't need the abstractions we've built our entire industry around.

I know this sounds crazy. You're probably thinking, "But we just invested years learning these tools!" Here's the thing though - AI agents **don't operate** like humans. They don't get overwhelmed by complexity in the same way we do. They don't need user-friendly abstractions. And that changes everything.

By the end of this video, you'll see exactly why the tools we consider essential today are actually **obstacles** for AI agents, and what's coming to replace them. But first, let me show you how we got here...

## [AI vs Developer: Can GitHub Copilot or Claude Replace My Job?](/ai/ai-vs-developer-can-github-copilot-or-claude-replace-my-job)

I just gave two AI agents the same complex coding task. One completely failed. The other... honestly shocked me.

But here's the twist: I'm not sure if I want the better one to succeed. Because if these autonomous coding agents can really implement full features from scratch, write tests, and handle edge cases like an experienced developer... well, we might all be looking for new careers sooner than we think.

Today, I'm putting GitHub Copilot's new coding agent head-to-head with Claude's autonomous agent. Same PRD, same requirements, zero hand-holding. And the results? Let's just say one of these agents just changed everything I thought I knew about AI coding.

## [Vibe Coding Explained: AI Coding Best Practices](/ai/vibe-coding-explained-ai-coding-best-practices)

**Vibe coding** is probably the hottest trend right now in the software industry. Instead of manually writing every line of code, we can now describe what we need in plain language and let AI agents generate code, run tests, perform some, if not all, SDLC operations, and whatever else we might need.

That's great since it means that now it is socially acceptable to talk to your computer. "Hello, precious. Can you write a Web app based on the OpenAI schema defined over there?" "Please be so kind as to fix this issue for me and make a patch release." "Would you mind working on that problem for a while longer?"

There's even a button now in VS Code that enables us to literally talk to AI through a microphone.

Vibe Coding is, in a way, still coding. We generate instructions for machines and those instructions are interpreted into binary code. The major difference is in the language we use. With "normal" coding, we do not become proficient just by writing code. We become proficient once we learn the rules, understand best practices, and practice (a lot). It's the same with Vibe Coding. The more we practice it and the better we understand the rules, the more proficient we become.

So, today I want to share my best practices for vibe coding. They are mine. They work well for me, and I am very curious to hear your thoughts.
