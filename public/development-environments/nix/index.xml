    <title>Nix for Everyone: Unleash Devbox for Simplified Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/development-environments/nix/index.html</link>
    <description>Nix is amazing, but also very difficult to manage. It assumes that you learned its programming language and that you are willing to ignore frastration generated by horrible documentation. I think it is one of the most useful projects out there that cannot be used by anyone but those willing to dedicate their lives to Nix.</description>
