    <title>About The DeveOps Toolkit</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/about/index.html</link>
    <description>We want to help you learn the tools and the processes that you should be using and applying in your day-to-day job. We want to help you make decisions. What works well, what doesnâ€™t work, why you should choose one tool over the other, and how to get up-to-speed quickly. Which tool works the best for a given task? What should we explore in more depth, and what is a waste of time?</description>
