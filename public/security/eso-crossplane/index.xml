    <link>http://localhost:1313/security/eso-crossplane/index.html</link>
    <description>Today I want to talk about secrets.&#xA;Don’t go away! I know that for many secrets is either boring or you think you already know everything there is to know about managing secrets. I will not talk about obvious “secret stuff”.
