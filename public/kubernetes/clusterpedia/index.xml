    <title>Single Pane of Glass for Kubernetes Clusters with Clusterpedia</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/kubernetes/clusterpedia/index.html</link>
    <description>For a while now, we have tools that promise that we can manage a fleet of Kubernetes clusters as one, yet they all failed to do just that. They all failed to provide a single pane of glass for all the clusters in a fleet. All the tools I know eventually show us what is happening in a single cluster and, honestly, I don’t need tools for that. I can easily see what’s going on in a cluster with kubectl or any, literally any, Kubernetes dashboard. What I’m missing, and what all the tools I tried so far fail to deliver, is a single pane of glass for all my Kubernetes clusters.</description>
