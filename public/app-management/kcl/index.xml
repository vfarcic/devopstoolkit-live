    <title>Exploring KCL: Configuration and Data Structure Language; CUE and Pkl Replacement?</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/app-management/kcl/index.html</link>
    <description>I’m in pain… and it’s self-inflicted… and I like it.&#xA;I tend to go through an endless number of tools, services, and format in search for better ways to do my job. I’m never satisfied. I always think that there is something better out there. So I go through pain of learning a new tool or a language only to jump into a new one shortly afterwards. Spending endless hours going through new stuff does not make sense, but I can’t help myself. Hopefully, I might save you from doing it yourself. That’s my goal. Go through the pain of trying out everything so that you don’t have to.</description>
